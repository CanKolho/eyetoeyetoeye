The sender (camera user) should follow in the small screen (PR) the placement of their own face in the center of the small screen, appropriately sized and at a good height. Vertically, one can also raise/lower their own face by tilting the screen forward/backward. The distance to the camera determines the size of the face. It's good to occasionally follow the lighting of your own face in the picture. You can change the microphone by right-clicking on the loudspeaker image at the bottom right. Choose 'open sound settings' and select '1080P PC camera' if necessary. The operation of the microphone can also be tested in this window, as well as change the camera in use if needed."
